# AI Hotel Booking Dashboard

This project is a single-page dashboard created using React.js, with a focus on Typescript, to visualize and analyze hotel booking data. The dashboard provides insights into the number of visitors, their origins, and age groups based on the selected date range. The data is sourced from a CSV file and is displayed through interactive charts.

## Features

- **Date Selector**: Allows users to select a date range to filter the data for analysis.

- **Time Series Chart**: Displays the number of visitors per day, where the total number is calculated as the sum of adults, children, and babies. It also offers zoomable functionality for detailed analysis.

- **Column Chart**: Shows the number of visitors per country, allowing users to see the distribution of visitors from different parts of the world.

- **Sparkline Charts**: These compact charts provide insights into specific visitor demographics. There are two sparkline charts:
    - Sparkline 1: Displays the total number of adult visitors.
    - Sparkline 2: Displays the total number of children visitors.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains 1,000 records of hotel bookings with the following columns:

- **arrival_date_year**: The year of arrival.
- **arrival_date_month**: The month of arrival.
- **arrival_date_day_of_month**: The day of arrival.
- **adults**: The number of adults for the booking.
- **children**: The number of children for the booking.
- **babies**: The number of babies for the booking.
- **country**: The country from which the travelers are from.

The data is sourced from the [hotel_bookings_1000.csv](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/caaad5c3-4460-4638-a3a6-3cb63b30c560/hotel_bookings_1000.csv) file.
